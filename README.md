# Applied learning task 2: Analytics

Hypothesising, making predictions, examining evidence, recognising patterns and reaching conclusions are at the heart of computer science. In this applied learning task, students will identify an interdisciplinary topic, develop a hypothesis and utilise existing resources to highlight the salient information and inform future decisions. By identifying, analysing, and deconstructing a problem, students will deepen their understanding of practices and principles of computer science.
